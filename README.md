### Hellou

Programming is my hobby, I do primarily Java/Minecraft and Web.

My proudest creations and contributions are:
- [Knossos](https://github.com/modrinth/knossos) - A large custom Nuxt.js application, serving as a frontend for Modrinth mod hosting
- [Yaga](https://github.com/falseresync/yaga) - A contentful Minecraft/Fabric mod, featuring pagan brewery

I am always happy to outside contributors and to derivatives of my work.

You can reach me at my own cozy Discord server: https://discord.gg/Wy9ns2RGnY
